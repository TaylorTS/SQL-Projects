# SQL-Projects
_The sole purpose of analyzing the datasets and completing the projects below is self-learning. The files included in this repository are only to showcase my knowledge and self-learning progress in SQL and data analytics._

## 1. Airbnb Listing Data Analysis
In this project, I worked with a dataset ("New") that contained Airbnb listing information in Asheville, NC to answer a few key business questions. It allowed me to combine my skills in both SQL and Python, as the primary data cleaning and pre-processing were done through Python and further analysis was done through writing SQL queries. 

The dataset used in this project was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com. For more information about how I used Python to complete data cleaning and pre-processing, please see [here](https://github.com/TaylorTS/SQL-Projects/blob/main/SQL_Project2_Airbnb%20Listing.ipynb). The codes were executed through Google Colab Notebooks. 

#### Key questions answered:
1. What property type is the most expensive property in this dataset? How much does it cost to rent this type of property on average?
2. What type of property is the most reasonably priced?
3. I'd like to look for something immediately available for at least 5 nights and has the highest rating. Is it possible? If so, how much does it cost per night?

## 2. Employment Data Analysis
This project was completed while I was taking a SQL course through Udemy. I worked with an employment/HR data set to answer varies questions and created a Tableau dashboard to show the analysis results.
