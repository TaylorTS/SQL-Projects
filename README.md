# SQL-Projects
## 1. Airbnb Listing Data Analysis
In this project, I worked with a dataset ("New") that contained Airbnb listing information to answer a few key business questions. It allowed me to combine my skills in both SQL and Python, as the primary data cleaning and pre-processing were done through Python and further analysis was done through writing SQL queries. 

For more information about how I used Python to complete data cleaning and pre-processing, please see [here](https://github.com/TaylorTS/SQL-Projects/blob/main/SQL_Project_Airbnb.ipynb). The codes were executed through Google Colab Notebooks. 

#### Key questions answered:
1. What property type is the most expensive property in this dataset? How much does it cost to rent this type of property on average?
2. What type of property is the most reasonably priced?
3. I'd like to look for something immediately available for at least 5 nights and has the highest rating. Is it possible? If so, how much does it cost per night?
